/**
 * Generic single-frame webcam capture client-tool (PLAT-18).
 *
 * Promoted up from pukeko-robot-controller: a single-frame webcam capture is a
 * general capability, not robot-specific. This module is the shared "thin tool
 * layer" — the `capture_image` tool declaration, the capture-to-envelope
 * handler, and small capture-source helpers — so any host registers the tool
 * once and it works on BOTH UI surfaces:
 *
 *   - bespoke `ChatInterface`: spread {@link createCaptureImageClientTool} into
 *     its `clientTools` / `clientToolHandlers` props;
 *   - headless CopilotKit: pass `createCaptureImageFrontendTool()` (from the
 *     `./copilot` sub-export, which wraps {@link captureImageResult}) through
 *     the `frontendTools` prop of `HeadlessChatApp` / `PukekoCopilot`.
 *
 * ## Frozen contract (RC-14)
 * The tool NAME (`capture_image`) and the result envelope — a JSON string of
 * `{ mimeType, data }` on success or `{ error }` on failure — are load-bearing:
 * per-tool result renderers (PLAT-17; e.g. the robot's inline thumbnail) and
 * server-side middleware key on both. Do not change either shape here.
 *
 * ## Server side
 * No server-side stub is required for a gaunt-sloth AG-UI host: the server
 * binds any client-declared run-input tool as a `metadata.client = true`
 * interrupt stub (apiAgUiModule's `buildClientToolStub`), suspending the graph
 * for the browser to fulfil. Hosts that statically configure their agent's
 * tools may still declare their own equivalent stub server-side, but it is
 * redundant as soon as the client declares `capture_image` in the run input.
