/**
 * RC-45: the compositing canvas must not die with the camera.
 *
 * `composeBeforeAfter` draws two supplied data URLs onto a hidden canvas. It never
 * reads the camera stream and never checks `isActive` — but the canvas used to live
 * inside the `v-else` of the `v-if="error"` branch, so a rejected `getUserMedia`
 * removed it from the DOM and `composeBeforeAfter` returned null at its first line.
 * That broke motion before/after composites for the simulated, no-hardware world
 * (RC-5), which is precisely the case the feature exists for.
 *
 * These cells pin the canvas's independence from camera state in BOTH camera-less
 * states — rejected and never-settling — while pinning that the error banner and
 * `captureFrame`'s active-camera guard are untouched.
 *
 * ## jsdom stubbing, and why it is needed
 * jsdom implements neither a 2D canvas context nor image decoding. Left alone,
 * `loadImage` would await an `onload` that never fires and the cell would HANG
 * rather than fail. So `HTMLImageElement`'s `src`/`width`/`height` and
 * `HTMLCanvasElement`'s `getContext`/`toDataURL` are patched on the prototypes and
 * restored after every test.

/**
 * RC-54: every `composeBeforeAfter` failure rejects, naming its cause.
 *
 * The function had three shapes of failure and declared only one: a missing
 * canvas and a missing 2D context returned `null`; an undecodable frame
 * rejected; and a panel unmounted while the two frames were decoding threw a
 * raw `TypeError` from a re-read of the ref after the await, which TypeScript
 * could not see because narrowing survives an `await` unsoundly. All three ran
 * against a `Promise<string | null>` signature that mentioned none of them.
 * These cells pin the uniform protocol: no failure VALUE, an `Error` per path,
 * and a message that says which path it was.
 *
 * ## Why the message, and not merely that it threw
 * The consumer is an agent reading a tool result, which turns the rejection into
 * an error string and abandons the remaining steps. Under the old protocol a
 * `null` from a decode failure was indistinguishable from a `null` from an
 * absent canvas; under this one an `Error` from one path can stand in for an
 * `Error` from another just as silently. So every cell below asserts the
 * MESSAGE. A cell asserting only `rejects.toThrow()` would pass with every
 * cause reporting the same thing — an assertion that cannot fail in the way
 * that matters.
 *
 * ## What jsdom can and cannot establish here
 * jsdom decodes nothing, so the stubbed `onerror` above proves only what it was
 * told to fire. The gap was closed out of band on the previous lane with a real
 * Chromium probe over byte-identical `data:` URLs: `error` fires, `load` does
 * not, the `src` assignment throws nothing synchronously, and a genuine 1x1 PNG
 * fires `load` in the same probe — so the result discriminates rather than
 * everything simply failing. Production's `loadImage` has exactly that one
 * failure channel, so `onerror` is the only real input that reaches this path.
 * `BEFORE_URL`/`AFTER_URL` are themselves not decodable images (`QkVGT1JF` is
 * ASCII `BEFORE`); the size table is what makes them "load", and it must stay a
 * table — making the fixtures really decodable would redden RC-45's cells.
