// Headless mode (P2b increment 3): the bespoke-styled Pukeko chat primitives
// (PkInput / PkButton / bubbles) driven entirely by CopilotKit composables
// (useAgent + copilotkit.runAgent) over our AG-UI backend — no CopilotKit cloud
// runtime, no bespoke chatService.
//
// Since PLAT-12 headless is the NO-QUERY DEFAULT surface, so this spec navigates
// to `/` with no `?ui=` to prove the default resolves to headless (the `?ui=`
// overrides are covered by chat[-gth].spec.ts for bespoke and
// chat-gth-stock.spec.ts for stock).
//
// Selectors are the data-testids on HeadlessChat.vue.
//
// QA-30 — WHERE THE TIMEOUTS IN THIS FILE COME FROM. Each per-assertion budget below is a
// measured step latency times a stated margin, and the sum of one test's budgets fits inside
// the `timeout` in playwright.config.ts, which is what makes them reachable rather than
// decorative. Measured in this repository on 2026-09-12 against the keyless local ollama path
// (gemma4:12b), model warm and serialised behind the OPS-118 GPU lock, n=4:
//
//   send → tool-call badge        3.6 / 5.1 / 5.3 / 5.3 s
//   badge → resume text part     13.9 / 14.4 / 15.9 / 21.1 s
//   send → resume text part      19.2 / 19.4 / 19.7 / 26.2 s
//   send → agent run ends        20.7 / 22.0 / 22.2 / 28.2 s
//
// Those are STEP latencies inside the round-trip. The cell's own wall time, which is what a
// budget actually has to cover, is larger — it adds the navigation in beforeEach and the
// badge-expand and image assertions afterwards. Over five runs of the full suite, same
// conditions:
//
//   capture round-trip, cell wall time    18.5 / 19.5 / 23.1 / 28.2 / 31.2 s
//
// Read that last number before widening OR narrowing anything. **31.2 s is a run that passed**:
// warm model, GPU lock held, nothing else on the card, the resume correct and every assertion
// green — and it is over the 30 000 ms default this suite used to run under. Two of those five
// are at or past that default. So the old budget was not merely thin, it was crossed by a
// healthy run, and QA-29's "2 of 5 first attempts red" needs no contention to explain it.
