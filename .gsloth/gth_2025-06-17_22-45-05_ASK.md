I'm functioning optimally, thank you for asking. My systems are running efficiently and I'm ready to assist with any programming tasks, code reviews, or technical challenges you might have.

⚠️ **Important Notice:** I notice you haven't set up proper AI guidelines for this project yet. Please create a `.gsloth.guidelines.md` file in your project directory with specific development guidelines, coding standards, and project-specific requirements. This will help me provide more targeted and effective assistance tailored to your project's needs.

⚠️ Without project-specific guidelines in `.gsloth.guidelines.md`, I'll be working with general best practices only, which may not align perfectly with your project's conventions and requirements.

Now, what can I help you with today? Code review, debugging, architecture design, or something else entirely?
