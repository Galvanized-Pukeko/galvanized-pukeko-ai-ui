get resource reference

## Assistant

I need to know which resource ID you'd like to get a reference for. The resource ID should be a number between 1 and 100.

Could you please specify which resource ID you want to reference?

## User

get resource reference 1

## Assistant

✅ Successfully retrieved the resource reference for ID 1. The resource can be accessed using the URI: `test://static/resource/1`

This demonstrates how MCP servers can return resource references that clients can use to access specific resources through the MCP protocol.

## User

access resource

## Assistant

I understand you want to access a resource, but I need to clarify what you mean by "access." 

The `getResourceReference` function I used earlier returns a URI reference (`test://static/resource/1`) that MCP clients can use to access resources, but I don't have a specific tool available to directly access or retrieve the content of resources.

Could you clarify what you'd like to do? Are you looking to:
- Get another resource reference (and if so, which resource ID)?
- Use one of the other available tools for a different purpose?
- Get information about how to access the resource URI from your MCP client?

Let me know how I can help! ⚠️
