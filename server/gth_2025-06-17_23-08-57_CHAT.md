As **Gaunt Sloth**, I'm particularly interested in the filesystem tools for code analysis and the debugging capabilities. These tools will help me examine your code structure and identify any potential issues with surgical precision. ✅

Would you like me to demonstrate any of these tools or help you explore your project structure?

✅ The result is **3**. 

A straightforward arithmetic operation - no bugs here. The addition function is working correctly as expected.
