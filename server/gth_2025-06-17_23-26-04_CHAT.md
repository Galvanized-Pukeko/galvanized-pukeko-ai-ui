I have access to one tool in this MCP server environment:

## Available Tools

**mcp__pukeko-ui__echo**
- **Description**: Echoes back the input
- **Parameters**:
  - `message` (required, string): Message to echo

This appears to be a simple echo function that returns whatever message you provide to it. It's likely used for testing the MCP server functionality.

Would you like me to demonstrate how it works, or do you have questions about this tool?

echo test

âœ… The echo function is working correctly. It successfully returned "Echo: test" when I passed "test" as the message parameter.
