# Code Instructions

## Running tests
### Running a single test
The underlying test command is `"run_single_test": "npm run test -w packages/${testPath}"`.
- the testPath DOES NOT accept backtick, semicolon, ampersand and pipe  
- the testPath DOES accept spaces

The project is set up as a monorepo, and to run a specific test you need to provide a package name, space and then test file name.
For example to run packages/demo-mcp/tests/setup.test.ts, the path string should be `demo-mcp setup.test.ts`.

Passing the package name only would allow running all tests within the package,
for example, providing `ui-mcp-server-js` will run all tests in "ui-mcp-server-js" package.

## Wokflow

The general workflow is the following:

- Implement a feature
- Implement or update tests
- Iterate for tests to pass
- Iterate for lint to pass
